# Requirement Review MCP Guide

This document explains how to run the repository's MCP server with review-first positioning.

## Positioning

The MCP surface should be understood in two layers:

- Core tools: review-only tools used to create and fetch review results
- Extension tools: retained source-integration, clarification, orchestration, and governance tools built on top of those review results

If you are integrating this repository for the first time, start with the core tools only.

As a default boundary:

- Prefer `prd_text` or `prd_path` when the MCP client can already fetch source content.
- Use connector-backed `source` when the MCP client is a weak caller that only knows the remote document identifier or URL.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Required model credentials in the environment
- Repository root as the working directory

## Start The MCP Server

```powershell
python -m requirement_review_v1.mcp_server.server
```

The server uses stdio transport and is normally launched by an MCP client.

## Core Review Tools

These are the primary tools to emphasize:

- `ping`
  - Health check for MCP connectivity
- `review_requirement`
  - Review-only facade for the project's main review-engine positioning
  - Accepts `source`, `prd_text`, `prd_path`, plus `metadata` or `options`
  - `source` supports local files, public text URLs, and authenticated Feishu/Lark documents
  - Returns `review_id`/`run_id`, `findings`, `open_questions`, `risk_items`, `conflicts`, `report_path`, and `review_mode`
- `review_prd`
  - Retained fuller workflow entrypoint for clients that still want metrics and downstream artifact paths
  - Accepts `prd_text`, `prd_path`, or `source`
  - Returns `run_id`, review metrics, and artifact paths
  - Surfaces controlled Feishu connector failures with explicit error codes such as `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND`, and `UNSUPPORTED_DOCUMENT_TYPE`
- `get_report`
  - Fetches `report.md` or `report.json` for a completed run
- `prepare_agent_handoff`
  - Prepares adapter-specific request payloads for `codex`, `claude_code`, or `openclaw`
  - Accepts either `run_id` or fresh PRD inputs (`source`, `prd_text`, `prd_path`)
  - Returns request file paths, context paths, prompt paths, and structured request payloads

Recommended input choice:

- Use `prd_text` for strong callers that already fetched the requirement content.
- Use `source` for weak callers that need PRD-Pal to fetch and normalize the source document.

Recommended first integration flow:

1. Call `ping`
2. Call `review_requirement`
3. Use the returned `review_id` or `run_id`
4. Call `get_report`
5. Optionally call `prepare_agent_handoff` when a downstream coding agent should continue from the reviewed artifacts

Feishu source setup:

- Set `MARRDP_FEISHU_APP_ID` and `MARRDP_FEISHU_APP_SECRET` in the MCP server environment before calling `review_requirement` or `review_prd` with Feishu sources.
- Use `MARRDP_FEISHU_OPEN_BASE_URL` only when you need a non-default Open API base URL.
- Supported Feishu document types are `wiki`, `docx`, and legacy `docs` sources that can be converted to `docx`.

## MCP And Feishu Plugin Boundary

The Feishu main-entry pluginization does not replace the MCP server.

Use MCP when:

- an internal tool, IDE agent, or automation wants to call `review_requirement` directly
- the caller already has its own identity and access-control layer
- you do not need Feishu callback routing or H5 rendering

Use the FastAPI Feishu entry layer when:

- the caller is a Feishu app, plugin, bot, or card action
- you need `/api/feishu/events`, `/api/feishu/submit`, or `/api/feishu/clarification`
- you need the compact result page at `/run/<run_id>?embed=feishu`
- you want run-level Feishu entry metadata and lightweight access checks persisted under `outputs/<run_id>/`

Recommended production split:

1. Deploy one backend instance.
2. Enable Feishu app credentials and webhook verification in that backend.
3. Let Feishu traffic hit the FastAPI layer.
4. Let internal automation and agent workflows keep using MCP.

This keeps review logic single-sourced while leaving protocol adaptation in the HTTP integration layer.

## Core Example

Use any MCP client to call:

```json
{
  "tool": "review_requirement",
  "arguments": {
    "source": "docs/sample_prd.md"
  }
}
```

Then fetch the report:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_report",
  "arguments": {
    "run_id": "20260309T000000Z",
    "format": "md"
  }
}
```

Prepare all supported downstream handoffs from the same run:

```json
{
  "tool": "prepare_agent_handoff",
  "arguments": {
    "run_id": "20260309T000000Z",
    "agent": "all"
  }
}
```

## Core Outputs

Every review run centers on:

- `report.md`
- `report.json`
- `run_trace.json`

When the multi-reviewer path is selected, the run may also include:

- `review_report.json`
- `risk_items.json`
- `open_questions.json`
- `review_summary.md`

The implementation may also persist additional extension artifacts in the same run directory, but those are not required to understand the core MCP usage.

When the run starts from connector-backed `source`, the persisted artifacts also retain `source_metadata` where supported so downstream MCP clients can trace the origin of the reviewed document.

## Optional Human-Loop Tool

- `answer_review_clarification`
  - Applies user clarification answers to a persisted review result
  - Accepts `run_id`, `answers`, and `options`
  - Best used by caller-side agents that handle the user conversation but want project-side persistence for the refreshed review state

## Extension Tools

The repository retains additional MCP tools for downstream orchestration and governance:

- `generate_delivery_bundle`
- `approve_handoff`
- `get_review_workspace`
- `handoff_to_executor`
- `update_execution_task`
- `list_execution_tasks`
- `get_execution_status`
- `get_traceability`
- `get_template_registry`
- `get_audit_events`
- `retry_operation`

These tools are extension-layer tools. They remain available because the corresponding code is still in the repository.

## Extension Workflow Example

Only after a review result exists, an extension flow can continue with:

1. `generate_delivery_bundle`
2. `approve_handoff`
3. `handoff_to_executor`
4. `get_execution_status`
5. `get_traceability`

This is optional and should not be confused with the main review architecture.

## Notes For Client Authors

- Prefer `prd_text` for strong clients that can already fetch and normalize source content.
- Prefer `source` when the client is intentionally delegating document fetch and normalization to PRD-Pal.
- Keep `prd_text` and `prd_path` for backward compatibility.
- Treat `review_requirement` as the review-only facade.
- Treat `review_prd` as the richer compatibility surface when you intentionally need bundle-adjacent artifact paths in the same response.
- Treat review completion as successful even if you do not use any orchestration tool.
- Do not assume extension tools are deprecated; they are retained, just not first-layer.
