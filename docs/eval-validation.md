# Eval Validation Guide

Use the smoke profile for day-to-day development when you need a fast regression signal on the core cases.

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/run_eval.py --profile smoke --workers 1
```

Use bounded parallel execution to shorten smoke/full eval wall time when cases are independent.

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/run_eval.py --profile smoke --workers 2
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/run_eval.py --workers 2
```

Use the full profile before release to run the complete case set and generate the full latency breakdown.

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/run_eval.py
```

Run the deterministic smoke script when you want a quick confidence pass over the CLI and FastAPI review entrypoints without depending on live model calls.

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/smoke_review_engine.py
```

Both commands write artifacts under `eval/`:

- `eval/eval_report.json`
- `eval/smoke_report.json`
- `eval/runs/`

The current skill cache is process-local in-memory TTL cache. Eval parallelism in `run_eval.py` does not provide cross-process cache sharing, and separate CLI runs should not be treated as cache-hit evidence.

## Runtime Summary Signals

`eval/eval_report.json` now includes both `duration_summary` and `runtime_summary`.

`runtime_summary` highlights:

- aggregate latency across completed cases
- aggregate cache hit/miss counts and hit rate
- cache backend usage seen in trace spans
- the slowest per-case runtime span
- any cases that finished with failed spans in trace

Each case result also includes a compact `runtime_summary` snapshot derived from the completed trace so release checks can spot regressions without reading the entire trace file.

Use the review-mode comparison script when you want a minimal A/B validation of the parallel-review enhancement on at least two PRDs with different complexity levels.

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/compare_review_modes.py
```

The default comparison runs `single_review` and `parallel_review` against `prd_case_08` and `prd_case_11`, then writes the summary report to `eval/review_mode_comparison.json` and per-run artifacts under `eval/review_mode_comparison_runs/`.

If you need to choose specific PRDs, repeat `--case-id` and provide at least two ids:

```bash
D:\venvs\marrdp\Scripts\python.exe eval/compare_review_modes.py --case-id prd_case_08 --case-id prd_case_11
```

The comparison report records these metrics for each mode: `findings_count`, `open_questions_count`, `risk_items_count`, `conflicts_count`, and `duration_ms`. Stable token accounting is currently recorded as `not available`.
